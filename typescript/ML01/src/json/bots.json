          "This year one of my knowledge-building goals is to learn about machine-learning and artifical intelligence. Other topics that peak my interest that coincide with these are robotics, automation, speech/text recognition, etc. I decided to focus on machine-learning this time around just to gather the conceptual knowledge of machine learning. Perhaps, it is not such a farfetched topic that requires years of Mathematics to begin. Perhaps, machine learning could be applied immediately to our present applications. That is what we will explore in this multipart article series. In this first part, we will describe the machine learning model in the simplest way possible, outlining the pieces needed to create a model. Keep in mind that we will be describing them in terms of abstract pieces, so try not to focus on the nomenclature of each abstract piece, but the function in terms of the others. ",

          "Just like humans require a certain spark to get us out of bed every morning and to achieve our days in top quality, our machine learning model may/or may not require a foundational goal, purpose, or source of motivation. It could be as simple as \"the model wants to learn in order to improve <something>\". This provides a base case for a recursive learning function and other nested recursions and their base cases could be inspired by the drives and motivators. The reason why this is necessary is because it serves as a fallback so that the model doesn't spin in one direction. For example, without purpose, what would stop a model from learning one particular item over and over again for the sole random purpose of setting that record of learning it the most number of times. Purpose has to be guided and laid as a foundation by the developer. Perhaps to be progressed by the model as it improves its discovery, but there must be a foundation for an optimal model.",
